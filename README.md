# How To Write Docs

Nodos documentation is written using markdown syntax and we use MkDocs and Material theme for now.
If you want to contribute or extend Nodos documentation, you can follow these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/mediaz/docs.git
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
```

To start serving locally from http://127.0.0.1:8000/

mkdocs serve
```
Then you should create a pull request for your commit in our documentation.
