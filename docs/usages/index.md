# Usage Instructions

1. **Creating Nodes**: Develop your nodes using C++ or the C API. Refer to the API documentation for detailed instructions.
2. **Integrating Shaders**: Write your shaders in GLSL or HLSL. Nodos will handle the compilation and runtime linking automatically.
3. **Building the Node Graph**: Use the Nodos interface to connect and configure your nodes, creating the desired graph structure.
4. **Running the Graph**: Execute the node graph within Nodos to see your code and shaders in action.
